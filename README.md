# Hi there! 👋

I'm Shangdian (King) Han.

At [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/ 'Microsoft') Research, I prototyped the new Office AI for Excel.

I believe high-quality code generation AI will be the most important development for human civilization in the near future, for the simple reason that code shapes our world today.

That's why I'm building an LLM agent customization platform to enhance the SOTA in code generation AI.
