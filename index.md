# A note on my name 我的英文名

My real given name is 尚典 (shàng diǎn). However, my mom also gave me another name 金 (jīn), which is pronounced as "kim" in Korean. The most natural choice for my English name would be Kim or Jin. My mom liked neither of them and thought: How cool would it be if I name my son King? And that's how I got my name.

我本名“韩尚典”，但是我妈给我起了个小名叫“韩金”。要上幼儿园了，取啥英文名呢？我妈一拍脑袋，那就叫“King”吧！于是我就叫King了。
